# WeatherDashboard-API-Challenge
OSU Bootcamp - Week 6 Homework Challenge

This week's challenge required us to use third-party APIs to access data and functionalityby making requests with specific parameters to a URL. I built a weather dashboard application that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS using the 5 Day Weather Forecast to retreive weather data for cities.

## Weather Dashboard Demo

The following gif shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
